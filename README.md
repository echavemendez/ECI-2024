# ECI-2024
All the material from the courses that i took while at ECI 2024

The course "LLM's: Zero to (almost) hero!" was given by Giovani Trappolini  (asistant profesor at Sapienza University, Rome), and tackled the main building blocks for understanding deep learning and neural networks. We worked our way up the complexity ladder and ended up understanding the inner workings of the LLM's.

The course "Deep learning for computer vision and scene understanding" was given by Helisa Dhamo (researcher at «Noah’s Ark» laboratory from Huawei, UK). We saw a broad range of architectures and models with the objective of understanding the implications and advantages of deep learning applied to CV. Great course, very informative.
